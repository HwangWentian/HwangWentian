# An Autobiography
Hwang Wentian, born in Jiangxi Province, China, in 2009, is currently studying in Zhejiang Province. I got good grades, but I don't think it really matters.

I got into computers when I was 6 years old and got into programming soon after. My father is good at using "Yi Language" (a programming language that uses Chinese as a program code, it is famous for "Yi" and its founder is Wu Tao), so my first programming language is also "Yi Language". For the first time, I learned about the terms variables, data types, judgments, functions, and classes. In the difficult self-study, I gradually realized the joy of arranging these characters to run.

Of course, I also want to know how other people program. But the search engine results surprised me - most people are using languages ​​like C++, Java, Python!

After thinking about it for a long time, I decided to start learning Python.

At that time, my basic English was only to know words such as cat, cup, so, run, so the language difference was a big barrier for me.

Slowly, I also compiled some small results (such as encrypting a file with a key, see [encryption of files](https://github.com/HwangWentian/symmetric_encryption) for details)

It can be seen that even without a good learning environment, we can still do something well!

As for C++, I was forced to learn it. I participated in the NOI (National Olympiad in Informatics) team at my school. NOI's competition language did not have Python, so I had to learn C++ from scratch.

However, C++ opened my eyes, and its lower-level logic really changed my way of thinking.
